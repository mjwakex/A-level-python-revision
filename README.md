# A-level-python-revision
These where my A-level python notes for my practical.
This was for the Cambridge 9618 course.
I sat this exam in May 2022 and was going to delete this repo.
Instead, I've decided to make it public for two reasons:

1) Someone studying this might find this usefull
2) I want to make my progrss as a comp sci student public.

I want to show beginner programmrs, that if you just stick with it
even when losing confidence, you can do it!

Enjoy,
Marcus (2024)
